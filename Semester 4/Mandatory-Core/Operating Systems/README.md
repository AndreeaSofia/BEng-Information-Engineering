# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Operating Systems** course during the fourth semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course covers key topics related to **Operating Systems**, including **Unix OS: External Interfaces** (general structure of an OS, regular expressions, filters, Unix shells, shell programming, directory structures, symbolic and hard links), **Unix Operating System** (system calls, internal structures, file and process management, I/O operations, process management systems, inter-process communication, POSIX threads), **Filesystems** (disk and file system management, planning disk access, internal structures of various file systems including DOS FAT, Windows NT & 2000 NTFS, Unix i-node mechanism), **General Theory of Operating Systems** (types of computers and OS classifications, I/O channels, multiprogramming, general OS structure and functions, process concepts and scheduling, memory management, and internal-external memory exchange planning), and more.

## Languages. Frameworks. Software tools

## How to Navigate This Course

Each course directory contains the following subfolders:

- **Courses**: Course notes and suggested bibliography.
- **Seminaries**: Seminary work and suggested bibliography.
- **Laboratories**: Lab work and related materials.
- **ExamPrep**: Exam papers, preparation materials/examples, and grade specifications (including a breakdown of weights for different parts of the final grade, such as course participation, practical exams, seminar activities, laboratory work, projects, etc.).
- **ExtraResources**: Additional exercises and work I did for certain chapters, along with personal tips and tricks, including tools, references, or books that helped me improve my understanding and performance in the subject. These are my own experiences and may not necessarily be useful for others, and were not required or endorsed by the course instructors.

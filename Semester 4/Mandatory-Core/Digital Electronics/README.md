# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Digital Electronics** course during the fourth semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course covers key topics concerning **Digital Electronics**, including **Introduction to Digital Electronics** (number systems and codes, digital electronic signals and switches, basic logic gates), **Combinatorial Logic** (Boolean algebra and reduction techniques, arithmetic operations and circuits, data control structures), **Logic Design and Flip-Flops** (logic families, various types of flip-flops and registers), **Sequential Logic and Timers** (counter circuits, shift registers, multivibrators, and timers), and **Real-World Interfacing** (analog-to-digital, digital-to-analog, signals and signal conditioning).

## How to Navigate This Course

Each course directory contains the following subfolders:

- **Courses**: Course notes and suggested bibliography.
- **Seminaries**: Seminary work and suggested bibliography.
- **Laboratories**: Lab work and related materials.
- **ExamPrep**: Exam papers, preparation materials/examples, and grade specifications (including a breakdown of weights for different parts of the final grade, such as course participation, oral exams, seminar activities, laboratory work, projects, etc.).
- **ExtraResources**: Additional exercises and work I did for certain chapters, along with personal tips and tricks, including tools, references, or books that helped me improve my understanding and performance in the subject. These are my own experiences and may not necessarily be useful for others, and were not required or endorsed by the course instructors.

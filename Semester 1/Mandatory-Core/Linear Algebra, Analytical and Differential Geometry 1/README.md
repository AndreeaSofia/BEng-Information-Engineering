# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Linear Algebra, Analytical and Differential Geometry 1** course during the first semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- The first semester of this course covers key topics in **Linear Algebra**, including **Algebraic Structures** (groups, rings, fields), **Matrix Theory** (matrix rings, determinants, rank and inverse of matrices, systems of linear equations, elementary matrix operations), **Vector Spaces** (vector spaces, subspaces, linear maps, linear independence, bases, dimension, exchange theorem), **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors** (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, diagonalizable matrices, Hamilton-Cayley theorem), and **Bilinear and Quadratic Forms**.

## Languages. Frameworks. Software tools

## How to Navigate This Course

Each course directory contains the following subfolders:

- **Courses**: Course notes and suggested bibliography.
- **Seminaries**: Seminary work and suggested bibliography.
- **Laboratories**: Lab work and related materials.
- **ExamPrep**: Exam papers, preparation materials/examples, and grade specifications (including a breakdown of weights for different parts of the final grade, such as course participation, oral exams, seminar activities, laboratory work, projects, etc.).

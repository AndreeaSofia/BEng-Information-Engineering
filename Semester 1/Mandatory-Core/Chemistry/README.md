# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Chemistry** course during the first semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course covers key topics in **General Chemistry** (introduction to chemistry, atomic structure, electron configuration, chemical bonding, physical interactions, classification of elements and compounds) and **Inorganic Chemistry** (inorganic compounds, oxides, bases, salts, acids, and chemical reactions including stoichiometry, acid-base reactions, and redox reactions).

## Languages. Frameworks. Software tools

- This course required the use of the following software tools, languages, and/or frameworks:

## How to Navigate This Course

Each course directory contains the following subfolders:

- **Courses**: Course notes and suggested bibliography.
- **Seminaries**: Seminary work and suggested bibliography.
- **Laboratories**: Lab work and related materials.
- **ExamPrep**: Exam papers, preparation materials/examples, and grade specifications (including a breakdown of weights for different parts of the final grade, such as course participation, oral exams, seminar activities, laboratory work, projects, etc.).
- **ExtraResources**: Additional exercises and work I did for certain chapters, along with personal tips and tricks, including tools, references, or books that helped me improve my understanding and performance in the subject. These are my own experiences and may not necessarily be useful for others, and were not required or endorsed by the course instructors.

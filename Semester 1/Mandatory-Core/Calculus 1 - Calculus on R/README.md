# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Calculus 1 - Calculus on R** course during the first semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- The first semester of this course covers key topics from **Real Analysis** (real numbers, sequences, series, limits, continuous functions), **Differential Calculus** (differentiation, mean value theorems, higher order derivatives, Taylor's theorem), and **Integral Calculus** (Riemann integral, primitives, improper integrals, Riemann-Stieltjes integral).

## Languages. Frameworks. Software tools

- This course required the use of the following software tools, languages, and/or frameworks:

## Weekly Topics

**Week 1:** 
- The system of real numbers (upper and lower bound of a set; minimum and maximum of a set; infimum and supremum of a set; the infimum principle, the supremum principle and its consequences; the sets of natural numbers, the set of integer numbers, the set of rational numbers, and the set of irrational numbers; the extended set of real numbers).
- Topology of the real axis (neighbourhoods, open sets, interior set, exterior set, boundary set, closure, accumulation points).

**Week 2:**

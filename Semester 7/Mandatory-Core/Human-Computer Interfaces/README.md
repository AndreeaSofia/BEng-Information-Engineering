# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Human-Computer Interfaces** course during the seventh semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course covers key topics concerning the **Interaction Between Humans and Computers**, including **Interaction Components** (the human, computer, and dialogue), **Interaction Design** (design process, models, principles, and usability), **Presentation Design**, **Information Architecture**, **Usability Evaluation**, and **Task Analysis**. Additionally, it explores practical aspects such as **Identifying Design Problems**, **Redesigning Interfaces**, **Checking Accessibility**, **User-Centric Design**, **Evaluating Usability**, and more.

## Languages. Frameworks. Software tools

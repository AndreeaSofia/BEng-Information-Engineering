# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Electronic Measurements, Sensors and Transducers** course during the seventh semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course covers key topics related to **Electronic Measurements, Sensors, and Transducers**, including the **Definition**, **Structure**, and **Role of Sensors and Rransducers in Automatic Systems**, **Data Acquisition through Various Transducers** (temperature, mechanical processes, electrical processes, flow, level, automotive, optical, and smart sensors), and the **Design and Development of Virtual Tools in LabVIEW** for **Real-Time Acquisition of Electrical and Non-electrical Quantities**. It also explores **Characteristics and Performance** of **Sensors/Transducers** in **Stationary and Dynamic Regimes**, **Real-Time Measurement Techniques** using LabVIEW, relevant topics in **Data Acquisition and Analysis**, and more.

# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Linear Algebra, Analytical and Differential Geometry 2** course during the second semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- The second semester of this course covers key topics in **Analytical and Differential Geometry**, including **Affine Geometry** (geometric vectors, vector space structure, Cartesian coordinate frames, affine subspaces), **Euclidean Geometry** (scalar product, Gram matrix, orthonormal frames, Gram-Schmidt process, spectral theorem), **Orientation and Transformations** (box product, cross product, projections, reflections, isometries), **Quadratic Forms** (ellipse, hyperbola, parabola, canonical equations, classification of quadrics, quadratic surfaces), **Curvature** (curvature of curves and surfaces), **Quaternions** (algebraic description, rotations) and more.

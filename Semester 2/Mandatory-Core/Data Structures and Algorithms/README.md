# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course during the second semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course, based on a **C++** curriculum, covers key topics related to **Data Structures and Algorithms**, including **Data Abstraction and Encapsulation**, **Array and Iterator Implementations**, **Linked Lists** (singly, doubly, and circular), **Abstract Data Types** (such as Sets, Maps, Matrices, Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues, and Deques), **Hash Tables** (including direct address tables, separate chaining, coalesced chaining, and open addressing), **Trees** (including Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and AVL Trees), **Binary Heap**, **Balanced Binary Search Trees**, and **Applications** and data structure libraries in various programming languages (Python, C++, Java, C#).

## Languages. Frameworks. Software tools

- This course required the use of the following software tools, languages, and/or frameworks:

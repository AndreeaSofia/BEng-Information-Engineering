# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Object Oriented Programming** course during the second semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course, based on **C** and **C++** curricula, covers key topics related to **Object Oriented Programming**, including an **Introduction to C/C++**, **Modular Programming** in C/C++, **Object-Oriented Programming** (object-oriented programming features, abstraction, encapsulation, classes and objects, access modifiers, operator overloading, static and friend elements), **Inheritance and Polymorphism** (base and derived classes, Liskov substitution principle, method overriding, static and dynamic binding, UML class diagrams), **Templates in C++** and the **C++ Standard Template Library**, **Streams and Exception Handling**, **Resource Management and RAII** (smart pointers, move semantics), **Graphical User Interfaces** (Qt Toolkit, Qt GUI components, layout management), **Event-Driven Programming** (callbacks, events, signals, and slots in Qt, MVC pattern), and **Design Patterns** (creational, structural, behavioral patterns).

## Languages. Frameworks. Software tools

- This course required the use of the following software tools, languages, and/or frameworks:

# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Calculus 2 - Differential and Integral Calculus in R^n** course during the second semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- The second semester of this course covers key topics in **Multivariable Calculus**, including **Topology and Sequences in R^n** (Euclidean space, topological structure, convergent and Cauchy sequences), **Multivariable Functions** (limits of vector functions, continuity, Weierstrass theorem, Frechet differentiability, partial derivatives, chain rule, mean value theorems, Lagrange multipliers, Taylor's formula), **Multiple Integration** (Riemann integrals on compact and bounded sets, iterated integrals, Fubini theorem, change of variables, vector functions of bounded variation, line integrals, differential forms), **Vector Calculus** (mechanical work, surface integrals, Stokes' theorem, Gauss-Ostrogradski formula), and more.

# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Electrical Engineering** course during the second semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course covers key topics in **Electrical Engineering**, including **Electrical Circuits** (active and passive elements, resistors, capacitors, coils, Kirchhoff's theorems, three-phase circuits), **Electromagnetic Fields** (notion of electromagnetic fields, electric fields, laws of electromagnetism for electric fields), **Magnetic Fields** (magnetic fields, laws of electromagnetism for magnetic fields), and **Electromagnetic Waves**.

## Languages. Frameworks. Software tools

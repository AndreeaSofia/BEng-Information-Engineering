# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Differential Equations** course during the third semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course covers key topics related to **Differential Equations**, including **Fundamental Concepts** (introduction to differential equations, analysis in Banach spaces, contraction principle, abstract data dependence principle), the **Cauchy Problem** (existence and uniqueness theorems in space and in a ball), **Mathematical Models Governed by Differential Equations**, **Linear Differential Equations** (with constant coefficients and systems), **Dynamical Systems** (generated by autonomous scalar differential equations and planar systems of differential equations), and **Applications and Approximations** (applications of dynamical systems theory and approximating methods for the Cauchy problem).

## Languages. Frameworks. Software tools

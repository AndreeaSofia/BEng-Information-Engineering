# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Programming Paradigms** course during the third semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course, based on **Java** and **C#** curricula, covers key topics spanning diverse **Programming Paradigms**, including an introduction to **Java Platform and Syntax**, **Collections and Generic Types**, **IO Operations**, **Functional Programming**, **GUI Development with JavaFX**, **Concurrency** (threads, executors, futures), **XML Processing**, **Metaprogramming** (reflection, serialization), and an **Introduction to C# and .Net**, including **Collections**, **IO Operations**, **GUI Development**, and **LINQ**.

## Languages. Frameworks. Software tools

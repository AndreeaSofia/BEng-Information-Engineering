# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Development of Applications for Mobile Platforms** course during the fifth semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course covers key topics related to the **Development of Applications for Mobile Platforms**, including **Base Android Tooling** (Android Studio, activity/fragment lifecycle, user interfaces), **Lists and REST Resources** (views, background processing, networking), **Master-Details and REST Resources** (more views: NavigationDrawer, OkHttp, JsonReader, JsonWriter, ContentProviders), **Local Persistence** (preferences and files, databases: SQLite, Room, Realm), **Security in Mobile Apps** (Android security model, JSON Web Tokens, OAuth 2.0), **Synchronizing Data** (WebSockets, local synchronization services, LoaderManagers), **Reactive Programming** (Realm - real-time database, Rx - reactive programming, coroutines), **System Services and Sensors** (services, processes, sensors), **Animations** (ValueAnimator, ObjectAnimator, Transitions framework), **Firebase Services** (authentication, database, remote config), **Monetization** (ads, in-app billing, Firebase), **Awareness and Nearby** (anticipate and react, Nearby, Physical Web), **App Testing** (JUnit, Mockito, UI Automator, Espresso, Firebase Test Lab, performance testing).

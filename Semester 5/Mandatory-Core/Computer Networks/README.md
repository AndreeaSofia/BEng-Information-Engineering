# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Computer Networks** course during the fifth semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course covers key topics concerning **Computer Networks**, including **Introduction to Computer Networks** (network examples, definitions), **Networking Protocols** (protocol concepts, protocol stacks, OSI and TCP/IP models), **Socket Programming** (TCP and UDP sockets, iterative and concurrent servers), **Network Topologies** (physical and data-link layers, network classes, and masks), **IP Addressing** (ARP, RARP, DHCP protocols), **Subnetting and Address Aggregation**, **Routing Protocols** (NAT, private and public IP addresses), **Network Security** (packet filtering, firewall issues), **Application Layer Protocols** (HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP, POP3, IMAP), **Web Client-Server Architectures**, **DNS and Email Systems**, and **Advanced Topics** (packet encapsulation at different TCP stack levels, VPN mechanisms and tunneling, VLANs).

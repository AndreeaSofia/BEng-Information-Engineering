# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Signals and Systems** course during the fifth semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course covers key topics concerning **Signal Processing** (definitions and properties of continuous and discrete signals, including sinusoidal, unit stage, pulse, ramp, exponential, and complex signals; transformations such as scaling, reflecting, and moving signals), **System Analysis** (analog and digital systems, features of analog-to-digital converters, modeling systems, linear and incremental systems, time-invariant systems, stability, and causality), and **Convolution** (properties and applications of convolution in discrete time, LTIS analysis, and impulse response of systems).

## Languages. Frameworks. Software tools

- This course required the use of the following software tools, languages, and/or frameworks:

# Bachelor of Engineering, _Information Engineering_ - "Babe»ô-Bolyai" University

This repository contains all of my learning and coursework during my Bachelor's of Engineering in **Information Engineering** over the course of 4 years, structured by semesters and types of courses. **The full courselist can be found at the bottom of this page.**

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by semesters, and within each semester, courses are categorized into:

- **Mandatory/Core**: Core courses **required** for the degree.
- **Optional/Core**: Optional courses within multiple available packages. Students are **required** take at least one or two courses from a single package, or a combination from different packages (depending on the semester) to fulfill credit requirements.
- **Optional**: Additional courses that are recommended but **not required**; they are chosen out of personal interest.

**Note:** _I have taken more classes than the overall minimum required to complete the degree, or the minimum semestrial requirements needed to pass. This repository includes all the courses I selected, including those **beyond** the **core** credits. This was done to gain a broader and deeper understanding of the subject matter and to explore various areas of personal interest within the field of Engineering._

Each course contains the following subfolders:

1. **Courses**: Course notes and suggested bibliography.
2. **Seminaries**: Seminary work and suggested bibliography.
3. **Laboratories**: Lab work and related materials.
4. **Exams**: Exam papers, preparation materials/examples, and grade specifications (including a breakdown of weights for different parts of the final grade, such as course participation, oral exams, seminar activities, laboratory work, projects, etc.).
5. **ExtraResources**: Additional exercises and work I did for certain chapters, along with personal tips and tricks, including tools, references, or books that helped me improve my understanding and performance in the subject. These are my own experiences and may not necessarily be useful for others, and were not required or endorsed by the course instructors.

## How to Navigate

1. **Select the Semester**: Choose the semester you want to explore.
2. **Choose the Course Type**: Inside each semester, courses are categorized into _Mandatory/Core_, _Optional/Core_, and _Optional_.
3. **Open the Course Folder**: Each course folder contains subfolders for course notes, seminaries, laboratories, exam prep, and extra resources.

## Full Courselist by Semester

Each semester folder contains the relevant courses categorized by type. For simplicity and to **avoid cluttering this main README**, all courses for each semester are listed together below without separating them into mandatory, optional/core, or optional here. They are already categorized as such in their respective folders. Furthermore, each course has its own README file linking to its subfolders, as detailed above.

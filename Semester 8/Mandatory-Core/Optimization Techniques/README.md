# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Optimization Techniques** course during the eighth semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course covers key topics related to **Optimization Techniques**, including **Optimization Problems in General Settings** (classical models, level sets, optimal solutions), **Convex Sets** (extreme points, properties), **Linear Optimization Problems** (duality theorems), **Bases** (primal, dual, optimal), the **Simplex Algorithm** (primal and dual forms), **Dual Problems** and **Extended Problems** (additional constraints), **Matrix Games** (relationship with linear optimization), **Solution Techniques for Convex Optimization Problems** (unconstrained and constrained), and more.

## How to Navigate This Course

Each course directory contains the following subfolders:

- **Courses**: Course notes and suggested bibliography.
- **Seminaries**: Seminary work and suggested bibliography.
- **Laboratories**: Lab work and related materials.
- **ExamPrep**: Exam papers, preparation materials/examples, and grade specifications (including a breakdown of weights for different parts of the final grade, such as course participation, practical exams, seminar activities, laboratory work, projects, etc.).

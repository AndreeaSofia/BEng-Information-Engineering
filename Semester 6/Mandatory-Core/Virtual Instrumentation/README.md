# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Virtual Instrumentation** course during the sixth semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course covers key topics in **Virtual Instrumentation**, including **System Graphical Design**, the **Industrial Internet of Things** (IIoT), **Graphical Programming in G** (Virtual Instruments, debugging, sequential programming, state machines, event-driven programming), and the **Programming and Optimization of Real-Time Systems** (multithreading, interprocess communication, reliability, debugging). Additionally, the course explores **FPGA Systems**, **Image Processing using VI**, **Human-Machine Interfaces**, **Data Output on Mobile** devices, **Rapid Prototyping with MyRIO**, **Real-Time Systems Modeling** (Model-in-the-Loop, Software-in-the-Loop, Hardware-in-the-Loop), and more.

# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Digital Signal Processing** course during the sixth semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course covers key topics related to **Digital Signal Processing**, including **Fundamental Concepts** (signals and systems, DSP applications, convolution sums), **Sequences and Systems** (LTI systems, FIR and IIR filters, causality, stability), **Transforms and Filtering** (Fourier series, Fourier transform, Laplace transform, Z-transform, FIR/IIR filter design, spectral estimation, deconvolution), **Sampling and Reconstruction** (amplitude modulation, Dirac comb, Nyquist limit, anti-aliasing filters, FFT based convolution), and **Advanced Topics** (time series analysis, wavelet transform, random signal processing, nonlinear time series analysis, connectivity measures), along with specific methods such as **Polynomial Representation**, **Heaviside Step Functions**, and more.

# Course Overview

- This README provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in the **Software Engineering** course during the sixth semester of my BEng in _Information Engineering_. This outline is designed to facilitate quick identification of relevant weeks for specific topics, especially when engaging with lab work or other course materials.
- This course covers key topics in **Software Engineering**, including the **Software Lifecycle Stages** (requirements elicitation, analysis, system design, object design, implementation, verification, and validation), **Software Process Models** (agile, waterfall, spiral), **Software Complexity Management** techniques (abstraction, decomposition, modeling), the **UML Language** (concepts, diagram types, syntax/semantics, tools), and **Advanced Topics** like **Design Patterns**, **Interface Specification**, **Design by Contract**, **Model-based Code Generation**, **Software Management**, **Model Driven Engineering** (MDE), and more.

## Languages. Frameworks. Software tools

- This course required the use of the following software tools, languages, and/or frameworks:

## How to Navigate This Course

Each course directory contains the following subfolders:

- **Courses**: Course notes and suggested bibliography.
- **Seminaries**: Seminary work and suggested bibliography.
- **Laboratories**: Lab work and related materials.
- **ExamPrep**: Exam papers, preparation materials/examples, and grade specifications (including a breakdown of weights for different parts of the final grade, such as course participation, practical exams, seminar activities, laboratory work, projects, etc.).
